These methods are relatively simple to understand and eﬀectively solve a wide variety of trajectory optimization problems. Throughout the paper we illustrate each new set of concepts by working through a sequence of four example problems. We start by using trapezoidal collocation to solve a simple one-dimensional toy problem and work up to using Hermite–Simpson collocation to compute the optimal gait for a bipedal walking robot. Along the way, we cover basic debugging strategies and guidelines for posing well-behaved optimization problems. The paper concludes with a short overview of other methods for trajectory optimization. We also provide an electronic supplement that contains well-documented MATLAB code for all examples and methods presented. Our primary goal is to provide the reader with the resources necessary to understand and successfully implement their own direct collocation methods.},

	abstract = {Autonomous parking has been a widely developed branch of intelligent transportation systems. In autonomous parking, maneuver planning is a crucial procedure that determines how intelligent the entire parking system is. This paper concerns planning time-optimal parallel parking maneuvers in a straightforward, accurate, and purely objective way. A unified dynamic optimization framework is established, which includes the vehicle kinematics, physical restrictions, collision-avoidance constraints, and an optimization objective. Interior-point method (IPM)-based simultaneous dynamic optimization methodology is adopted to solve the formulated dynamic optimization problem numerically. Given that near-feasible solutions have been widely acknowledged to ease optimizing nonlinear programs (NLPs), a critical region-based initialization strategy is proposed to facilitate the offline NLP-solving process, a lookup table-based strategy is proposed to guarantee the on-site planning performance, and a receding-horizon optimization framework is proposed for online maneuver planning. A series of parallel parking cases is tested, and simulation results demonstrate that our proposal is efficient even when the slot length is merely 10.19\% larger than the car length. As a unified maneuver planner, our adopted IPM-based simultaneous dynamic optimization method can deal with any user-specified demand provided that it can be explicitly described.},

As criteria for comparison a set of 271 features grouped in 30 characteristics and 6 areas has been selected. These features include the different metaheuristic techniques covered, mechanisms for solution encoding, constraint handling, neighborhood speciﬁcation, hybridization, parallel and distributed computation, software engineering best practices, documentation and user interface, etc. A metric has been deﬁned for each feature so that the scores obtained by a framework are averaged within each group of features, leading to a ﬁnal average score for each framework. Out of 33 frameworks ten have been selected from the literature using well-deﬁned ﬁltering criteria, and the results of the comparison are analyzed with the aim of identifying improvement areas and gaps in speciﬁc frameworks and the whole set. Generally speaking, a signiﬁcant lack of support has been found for hyper-heuristics, and parallel and distributed computing capabilities. It is also desirable to have a wider implementation of some Software Engineering best practices. Finally, a wider support for some metaheuristics and hybridization capabilities is needed.},

	abstract = {Current direct-collocation-based optimal control software is either easy to use or fast, but not both. This is a major limitation for users that are trying to formulate complex optimal control problems (OCPs) for use in on-line applications. This paper introduces NLOptControl, an open-source modeling language that allows users to both easily formulate and quickly solve nonlinear OCPs using direct-collocation methods. To achieve these attributes, NLOptControl (1) is written in an efﬁcient, dynamically-typed computing language called Julia, (2) extends an optimization modeling language called JuMP to provide a natural algebraic syntax for modeling nonlinear OCPs; and (3) uses reverse automatic differentiation with the acycliccoloring method to exploit sparsity in the Hessian matrix. This work explores the novel design features of NLOptControl and compares its syntax and speed to those of PROPT. The syntax comparisons shows that NLOptControl models OCPs more concisely than PROPT. The speeds of various collocation methods within PROPT and NLOptControl are benchmarked over a range of collocation points using performance proﬁles; overall, NLOptControl’s single, two, and four interval pseudospectral methods are roughly 14, 26, and 36 times faster than PROPT’s, respectively. NLOptControl is well-suited to improve existing off-line and on-line control systems and to engender new ones.},

	abstract = {Trajectory optimization is a widely used tool for robot motion planning and control. Existing solvers for these problems either rely on off-the-shelf nonlinear programming solvers that are numerically robust and capable of handling arbitrary constraints, but tend to be slow because they are general purpose; or they use custom numerical methods that take advantage of the problem structure to be fast, but often lack robustness and have limited or no ability to reason about constraints. This paper presents ALTRO (Augmented Lagrangian TRajectory Optimizer), a solver for constrained trajectory optimization problems that handles general nonlinear state and input constraints and offers fast convergence and numerical robustness thanks to careful exploitation of problem structure. We demonstrate its performance on a set of benchmark motion-planning problems and offer comparisons to the standard direct collocation method with large-scale sequential quadratic programming and interior-point solvers.},

These features include the different metaheuristic techniques covered, mechanisms for solution encoding, constraint handling, neighborhood speciﬁcation, hybridization, parallel and distributed computation, software engineering best practices, documentation and user interface, etc. A metric has been deﬁned for each feature so that the scores obtained by a framework are averaged within each group of features, leading to a ﬁnal average score for each framework. Out of 33 frameworks ten have been selected from the literature using well-deﬁned ﬁltering criteria, and the results of the comparison are analyzed with the aim of identifying improvement areas and gaps in speciﬁc frameworks and the whole set. Generally speaking, a signiﬁcant lack of support has been found for hyper-heuristics, and parallel and distributed computing capabilities. It is also desirable to have a wider implementation of some Software Engineering best practices. Finally, a wider support for some metaheuristics and hybridization capabilities is needed.},

	abstract = {An hp-adaptive pseudospectral method is presented for numerically solving optimal control problems. The method presented in this paper iteratively determines the number of segments, the width of each segment, and the polynomial degree required in each segment in order to obtain a solution to a userspeciﬁed accuracy. Starting with a global pseudospectral approximation for the state, on each iteration the method determines locations for the segment breaks and the polynomial degree in each segment for use on the next iteration. The number of segments and the degree of the polynomial on each segment continue to be updated until a user-speciﬁed tolerance is met. The terminology ‘hp’ is used because the segment widths (denoted h) and the polynomial degree (denoted p) in each segment are determined simultaneously. It is found that the method developed in this paper leads to higher accuracy solutions with less computational effort and memory than is required in a global pseudospectral method. Consequently, the method makes it possible to solve complex optimal control problems using pseudospectral methods in cases where a global pseudospectral method would be computationally intractable. Finally, the utility of the method is demonstrated on a variety of problems of varying complexity. Copyright ᭧ 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Current direct-collocation-based optimal control software is either easy to use or fast, but not both. This is a major limitation for users that are trying to formulate complex optimal control problems (OCPs) for use in on-line applications. This paper introduces NLOptControl, an open-source modeling language that allows users to both easily formulate and quickly solve nonlinear OCPs using direct-collocation methods. To achieve these attributes, NLOptControl (1) is written in an efﬁcient, dynamically-typed computing language called Julia, (2) extends an optimization modeling language called JuMP to provide a natural algebraic syntax for modeling nonlinear OCPs; and (3) uses reverse automatic differentiation with the acycliccoloring method to exploit sparsity in the Hessian matrix. This work explores the novel design features of NLOptControl and compares its syntax and speed to those of PROPT. The syntax comparisons shows that NLOptControl models OCPs more concisely than PROPT. The speeds of various collocation methods within PROPT and NLOptControl are benchmarked over a range of collocation points using performance proﬁles; overall, NLOptControl’s single, two, and four interval pseudospectral methods are roughly 14, 26, and 36 times faster than PROPT’s, respectively. NLOptControl is well-suited to improve existing off-line and on-line control systems and to engender new ones.},

However, it remains diﬃcult to ﬁnd the best strategy for production optimization. One challenge is to ﬁnd a good optimization algorithm, as some optimization algorithms require prohibitive work to compute the gradients of the objective function with respect to the well controls. These methods also require access to the simulator code, which makes them diﬃcult to use with commercial software. Another challenge is to ﬁnd a reasonable frequency for well control adjustment: adjusting well controls too frequently imposes unrealistic control burdens on operations, increasing well management cost. Moreover, high–frequency control adjustment increases the risk of optimization algorithms being trapped at local optima as the problem is more under–determined. On the other hand, excessively low–frequency control adjustment may not truly optimize oil recovery.},

After discretizing the optimal control problem we solve the resulting optimization problem with (i) A Mathematical Programming Language (AMPL), (ii) the Imperial College London Optimal Control Software (ICLOCS), (iii) the Gauss Pseudospectral Optimization Software (GPOPS) as well as with (iv) a new algorithm based on mixed-binary nonlinear programming reported in [7]. This algorithm consists on converting the optimal control problem to a Mixed Binary Optimal Control (MBOC) problem which is then transcribed to a mixed binary non-linear programming problem (MBNLP) problem using Legendre-Radau pseudospectral method. Our case study shows that, in contrast with the ﬁrst three approaches we test (all relying on IPOPT or other numerical optimization software packages like KNITRO), the MBOC approach detects the structure of the AUV’s problem without a priori information of optimal control and computes the switching times accurately.},

	abstract = {The optimal trajectory planning problem for train operations under constraints and ﬁxed arrival time is considered. The varying line resistance, variable speed restrictions, and varying maximum traction force are included in the problem deﬁnition. The objective function is a tradeoff between the energy consumption and the riding comfort. Two approaches are proposed to solve this optimal control problem. First, we propose to use the pseudospectral method, a stateof-the-art method for optimal control problems, which has not used for train optimal control before. In the pseudospectral method, the optimal trajectory planning problem is recast into a multiple-phase optimal control problem, which is then transformed into a nonlinear programming problem. However, the calculation time for the pseudospectral method is too long for the real-time application in an automatic train operation system. To shorten the computation time, the optimal trajectory planning problem is reformulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem by approximating the nonlinear terms in the problem by piecewise afﬁne functions. The MILP problem can be solved efﬁciently by existing solvers that guarantee to return the global optimum for the proposed MILP problem. Simulation results comparing the pseudospectral method, the new MILP approach, and a discrete dynamic programming approach show that the pseudospectral method has the best control performance, but that if the required computation time is also take into consideration, the MILP approach yields the best overall performance. More speciﬁcally, for the given case study the control performance of the pseudospectral approach is about 10\% better than that of the MILP approach, and the computation time of the MILP approach is two to three orders of magnitude smaller than that of the pseudospectral method and the discrete dynamic programming approach.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in theory, algorithms, and computational power make it possible to solve complex, optimal control problems both for off-line and on-line industrial applications. This paper starts by reviewing the technical details of the solution methods pertaining to three general categories: dynamic programming, indirect methods, and direct methods. With the aid of a demonstration example, the advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed, along with a brief review of available software. The main result that emerges is the indirect method being numerically competitive with the performance of direct ones based on non-linear programming solvers and interior point algorithms. The second part of the paper introduces an indirect method based on the Pontryagin Minimum Principle (PMP). It also presents a detailed procedure and software tools (named PINS) to formulate the problem, automatically generate the C++ code, and eventually obtain a numerical solution for several optimal control problems of practical relevance. The application of PMP relates to the analytical derivation of necessary conditions for optimality. This aspect—often regarded in the literature as a drawback—is here exploited to build a robust yet efficient numerical method that formally eliminates the controls from the resulting Boundary Value Problem, thus gaining robustness and a high convergence rate. The elimination of the control is obtained either via their explicit formulation function of state and Lagrange multipliers—when possible—or via an iterative numerical solution. The paper closes presenting a minimum time manoeuvre of a car using a fairly complex vehicle model which also includes tyre saturation.},

	abstract = {Background and objective
	For decades, mathematical models have been used to predict the behavior of physical and biological systems, as well as to define strategies aiming at the minimization of the effects regarding different types of diseases. In the present days, the development of mathematical models to simulate the dynamic behavior of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is considered an important theme due to the quantity of infected people worldwide. In this work, the objective is to determine an optimal control strategy for vaccine administration in COVID-19 pandemic treatment considering real data from China. Two optimal control problems (mono- and multi-objective) to determine a strategy for vaccine administration in COVID-19 pandemic treatment are proposed. The first consists of minimizing the quantity of infected individuals during the treatment. The second considers minimizing together the quantity of infected individuals and the prescribed vaccine concentration during the treatment.
	Methods
	An inverse problem is formulated and solved in order to determine the parameters of the compartmental Susceptible-Infectious-Removed model. The solutions for both optimal control problems proposed are obtained by using Differential Evolution and Multi-objective Optimization Differential Evolution algorithms.
	Results
	A comparative analysis on the influence related to the inclusion of a control strategy in the population subject to the epidemic is carried out, in terms of the compartmental model and its control parameters. The results regarding the proposed optimal control problems provide information from which an optimal strategy for vaccine administration can be defined.
	Conclusions
	The solution of the optimal control problem can provide information about the effect of vaccination of a population in the face of an epidemic, as well as essential elements for decision making in the economic and governmental spheres.},

GEKKO specializes in dynamic optimization problems for mixed-integer, nonlinear, and differential algebraic equations (DAE) problems. By blending the approaches of typical algebraic modeling languages (AML) and optimal control packages, GEKKO greatly facilitates the development and application of tools such as nonlinear model predicative control (NMPC), real-time optimization (RTO), moving horizon estimation (MHE), and dynamic simulation. GEKKO is an object-oriented Python library that offers model construction, analysis tools, and visualization of simulation and optimization. In a single package, GEKKO provides model reduction, an object-oriented library for data reconciliation/model predictive control, and integrated problem construction/solution/visualization. This paper introduces the GEKKO Optimization Suite, presents GEKKO’s approach and unique place among AMLs and optimal control packages, and cites several examples of problems that are enabled by the GEKKO library.},
